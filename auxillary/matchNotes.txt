How would I get the card that I need?
Solution 1:
I could have an entire array of the cards, and then compare the card selected to the array. So if
the array has 30 cards total, and I select card 6, then I need to check the array starting at index
0, one-by-one. I would eventually get to index 5, and see the card objects are equal, they match,
they have the same memory address.

Solution 2:
I have a card that a user selected. That card has children elements. One of the children would be an
img. <Card -> FrontCard -> Img.title> where Img.title would give the name of the animal. I could
still remove the even listner and save the object as a property in my Game object so I can readd
the event listner.
